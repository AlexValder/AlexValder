# About

Hi, my name is AlexValder and my main interests are games, game development and anime (and manga), and especially when all of this is combinated with at least a little of horror. My (natural) languages are English, Russian and Ukrainian.

I'm usually using Godot, though I want to use other game engines in future as well (this includes Unity and Unreal Engine). My skills are highest in C#, but I also write in Kotlin, Python and a little of C/C++.

Checkout my currently only somewhat finished gamedev-related projects: [Procedural Land Generation](https://github.com/AlexValder/ProceduralGeneration), [Labirynth Generation](https://github.com/AlexValder/MazeGeneration).
